# Next offline  PWA starter kit

This starter kit has grown out of need for an ongoing project. I have decided to create a separate repo of it for future re-use.

## How to use

Install it and run:

```bash
yarn --ignore-scripts & npm install -g flow-typed
npm run dev
```
__[why we have an ignore-scripts option on yarn install](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3533)__

## Development guidelines

Create a branch for which ever issue you are working on. After you are done create and submit a pull request to the master branch.
Before merging your pull request make sure the build passes on travis-ci
if you have linting errors consider running

```
npm run format
```

## [Buiding on top of next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js)

- The file system is your routes. Drop a new file in pages and it becomes a route
- Automatic code splitting at route level
- Does away with a lot of tooling configuration boilerplate

[if you are wondering why the file structure is so flat, checkout this linked next.js issue](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/91)

## Flow for types

[On why we chose flow for types](https://djcordhose.github.io/flow-vs-typescript/2016_hhjs.html)

 #### Making flow work well with external libraries
In oder to get the best out of flow we need type information for external libraries.
Flow helps with it through the [flow-typed](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-typed) tool
  >
  - ```$ npm install -g flow-typed``` (if not installed already)
  - ```$ flow-typed install ``` -- this installs all the flow type definitions relative to the project
  - when you add a new Dependency add its types as follows
  -  ```$ flow-typed install rxjs@5.0.x ```

There are dependencies for which flow-typed has no definitions for those have a look at [flowgen](https://github.com/joarwilk/flowgen) which offers away of transpiling typescript definitions to flow definitions.



## State management and data fetching with [apollo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) and [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
- Apollo graphql integration takes away a lot of data fetching boilerplate commonly found in react apps.
- Apollo graphql also allows for efficient data fetching through fewer network requests.

## [Atomic react design component development](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) with [storybook](https://storybooks.js.org/)

## Testing with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)

## Styling with [semantic UI](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React) and [glamorous](https://github.com/paypal/glamorous)

## [Offline access (PWA) with service worker](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) and [localForage](https://github.com/localForage/localForage) with [redux-persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist)
